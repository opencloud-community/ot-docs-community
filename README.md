# OpenTalk Community Documentation

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/opencloud-community/ot-docs-community/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opencloud-community/ot-docs-community/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository contains community-maintained deployment and operation documentation for [OpenTalk](https://opentalk.eu), focusing on practical setup guides and deployment scenarios.

## Purpose

While the official OpenTalk documentation provides comprehensive information about features and configuration options, this community documentation aims to:

1. Provide detailed deployment guides based on Docker Compose
2. Document various deployment scenarios (development, testing, production)
3. Offer practical step-by-step instructions for configuration and integration
4. Share troubleshooting tips and maintenance best practices
5. Create a bridge between the Docker Compose setup and the controller configuration

## Repository Structure

- `/docs/` - Main documentation directory
  - `/deployment/` - Documentation focused on deploying OpenTalk
    - `/docker-compose/` - Guides specific to Docker Compose deployments

## Integration with Official Documentation

This documentation is designed to complement the official OpenTalk documentation:
